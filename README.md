## Password Generator

# Process

The program will ask:
```
How many letters would you like in your password?
```
```
How many symbols would you like?
```
```
How many numbers would you like?
```
The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password. 

# Notes

In this project the final password does not follow a pattern. So after receiving user inputs and generating random letters, numbers, and symbols, then the order of the entire character set in the password is randomized and displayed to the user.

And every time you generate a password, the positions of the symbols, numbers, and letters are different.
